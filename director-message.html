               <p><b><p>Dr. Pankaj Kapooj is director of Kapoor Education Academy(school).</p></b>"Education is the all drawing out of the best in child and man- body, mind and spirit" Mahatma Gandhi Unity In Diversity Our school represents a cross section of the society and is a rich blanket of multi cultural diversity. Children come to us from varied cultural, social, racial and religious backgrounds. Within school they learn to live together as one big family, regardless of their roots and create newer and stronger bonds with each other that will last them a life time values.<br>
                    A Positive Approach The minds of chldren, contrary to our beliefs, are open. Friendships are formed on face values without any expectations. It becomes the responsibility of the school to ensure that all children put under its care are taught the importance of incukcating right ethics. These are urgent in order to develop as an individual, both mentally and emotionally. With us, the students leam to be upright and honest, they understand respect, they are taught to differentiate right from wrong and have the courage to stand up for what is correct.<br>

All of you are special and we want you to take pride in achievement. Each job is a self portrait of the person who does it, autograph your work with excellence. At the end I would Ike to thank all the parents who have reposed faith in our institution and the ideals it stands for.<br>
